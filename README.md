# Description 

### What you're creating?
- A task manager app stylized as a to-do list, where task completion affects a virtual pet's health and happiness.

### Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?
- The audience will be users that document their productivity or organize their daily tasks and errands, such as
	professionals, students, workers, etc. These types of users will also have familiarity/preference for 
	gaming, non-demanding challenges, and fun variations of technology based utilities. 

### Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?
- We hope to introduce a small change to time management and bullet lists that can transform them into a more interactive and fun
	experience. This can help impact the user's view of producutivity, and especially help blur the barrier
	between responsibility centered life and enjoyment.
